---

This repository contains all the scripts, and documentation used to identify and map **Priority Preservation Areas** (low shipping, high biodiversity) and **Priority Mitigation Areas** (high shipping, high biodiversity) across global marine territories. Its purpose is to support marine spatial planning and inform conservation policy regarding shipping impacts.
